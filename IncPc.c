  Filename:     IncPc.c
  Purpose:      Increments (or decrements) an Address_t structure, with 
                detection of out-of range.  This is a more complicated
                thing than it seems, because of the variety of different
                types of memory bank.  (Also, since the Address_t 
                structure can represent a constant rather than an address.)
  History:      04/15/03 RSB    Began.
                08/18/16 RSB    Some cross-my-finger-and-hope tweaks for
                                --block1.
