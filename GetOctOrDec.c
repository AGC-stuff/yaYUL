  Filename:     GetOctOrDec.c
  Purpose:      Interprets a field as a decimal or octal number.
  Mod History:  04/25/03 RSB   Split off from Parse2DEC.c.  Added a 
                               bunch of checking to it.
                01/28/17 MAS   Added support for implicit decimals
                               (numbers are automatical decimal if they
                               have an 8 or a 9)
